# Welcome to My Page

## What is this page about?
This page is mainly discuss about anything geospatial related stuffs from geospatial databases, geospatial data processing (raster and vector), and many more.
Check my pages on link below for more post about geospatial data processing.
## Geospatial Python
This page contains anything related about geospatial data processing with python. More posts are in progress. You can [visit this link](http://zectre.github.io/geospatialpython) to read more posts.

You can read about geospatial tools on python for geospatial data processing for both raster and vector data like geopandas, rasterio, earthpy, etc. 

## Geospatial Database
Managing geospatial data is like managing big data, it needs data science knowledge with a good database management system. I write stuffs about managing geospatial data with database management system like PostgreSQL with its well known geospatial extension PostGIS also with PGRouting for geospatial routing functionality. You can [visit this link](https://zectre.github.io/geospatialdatabase/) to see more posts about it.
## Road Damage Identification using YOLO 
In this research I was using YOLO with road damage dataset from IEEE road damage dataset (see more at https://github.com/sekilab/RoadDamageDetector)
I was using GNSS receiver for location data that will be used to determine the road damage location. I converted the location data into subtitle embeded on video. You can read more at https://github.com/zectre/yolo_rdd
![RDD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zectre/yolo_rdd/master/webmap/map/sampangan/output_0206.jpg)
The output will be an image of detected road damage with its location. You can see the road damage location detected with this [map](https://zectre.github.io/yolo_rdd/webmap/#16/-7.0000/110.4059)
